I was in my computer classand I was really interested in how the computer was able to display our nameson the desktop, I already at that time had some experience with browsing thefile structure because I had a Windows 3.1 computer in my room, and my parentshad a Windows 98 SE machine in the living room. I would click through thecomputer’s local drive when I was bored of surfing message boards over ourdial-up modem, mostly looking at how to bypass Internet filters at school. Iwould recursively look through the Windows directory, I even picked up some commandline experience from those forms.I was in computer class one day andbecame bored, idle hands are never a good ideal for kids, so I started lookingthrough the computer’s local hard drive, so I opened up My Computer on thedesktop and found there were additional drives, some I hadn’t seen before. So Istarted looking through the directories, opening up random files to see whatthey did or said. At this time class was still on-going, I never really payattention in computer classes anyways because I was usually way ahead of theclass. After a day or two of searching their network drives I ran into a loginlike script for the machines, it was a script that ran after you logged intoNovell. When I opened it I started looking though and noticed a line that referenceda BMP file and saying something about wallpaper, at that time I already knewwhat BMP’s were from looking through my own computer. So I copied the networklocation it was referencing and pasted it into my explorer URL bar and deletingthe last portion of the location that pointed to the file so that I could lookat the directory.I found the file that the computersused for the background, along with other files they used… but I didn’t reallycare too much for those, I just wanted the background. So I opened the filewith MS Paint… what to do… what to do. At this time I was a BIG PC gamer, Ieven tried making my own games using GameMaker and The 3D Game Maker, I’ve gota story about some mischievous things I’ve done with GameMaker, that and Batchwas how I learned some scripting. Any ways, back to the story. I really enjoyedHalo: CE, I liked playing that online, so of course that’s what I wanted toshare, call it free advertising lol. I clicked the text button and wrote “HaloRules!”—with one or more exclamation marks-- on the background and saved it…yes, it actually saved, the permissions on this network drive weren’t setupproperly.This wasn’t an instantaneouschange, the background was only pulled as part of the login, I needed to waituntil the next day, as my other classes didn’t use a computer unless we were writinga paper that needed to be type written. The next day we came in I smiled atseeing that written across everyone’s desktop, you would have thought that someonelike the principle would have noticed that and had someone remove it. But no,it stayed on there all day, and the next day… so I became a little excited, andme being a kid, wanted to share with my friends.I had a lot of friends, I wasn’t atypical loner nerd; I had some social skills because I just seem to get alongwith people, even though they tend to annoy me… a lot. I had been in troublebefore, but not as bad as elementary school where I had a pink slip almostevery day. At my middle school we had this after school program for playingwith SimCity 3000, it was supposed to be a contest for schools to participatein to build the best city, but I just wanted to game… of course I wasn’t goingto pass that up, I love PC gaming (simulation, RTS, racing, shooters, etc). Ihad some friends in this program too, I was having a conversation with one ofthem and I can’t remember if they asked about the background or if I just wantedto brag, It’s hard to say because peer-pressure never was a problem for me, ifpeople wanted me to do something I didn’t want to do I said no, continuing toask would typically just make me mad. Anyways, I shared with him the secrets ofsetting the background.I didn’t take long, actually thenext day, until I saw the background changed, with a lot of different things.If my memory is right, I saw stuff like “You all suck” kind of things. I don’thave much memory of what else they did because it really didn’t last long. Thenext day, pretty much two days after I told one friend and I’m sure he toldothers, we were waiting outside to enter the school, everyone waited outsideafter the bus dropped you off or if you walked to school before they opened thedoors, of course they had adults outside too. While we were all waiting, hurdledinto a social circles, the principle and someone else from the administrationwalked out, they were calling my name, and the friend that I told to come inside.My friend and I entered the principal’s office and she asked if I knew anythingabout the background, I of course said no… she then went on about how my friendsaid it was me who found it, and that I showed people how to do it… at thispoint I was giving my “friend” the death stare. She then said she had to paysomeone to come in and fix it up, I of course thought “oh shoot, I hope I don’thave to pay” so I said “I could have done that!” She ignored this, I later doubtedthat they had to pay a dime since the public school contracted that stuff outand who ever responded supported them until the contract was up. Instead shetold me not to do it again and sent us both outside… they eventually came backout because me and that “friend” got into a fight that escalated pretty quicklyfrom pushing each other.After then separated us I can’trecall what they did, but I’m sure we got Saturday detention, or in schooldetention, it’s hard to say because I did get Saturday and in school detentiona couple times during middle school; however, I did attend my computer class…that’s when I was informed by my computer instructor that I wasn’t allowed touse any of the computers without supervision… in any of my classes, this wouldn’tbe the first time I was told this, I have another story about this happening acouple more times in high school. He pretty much watched me like a hawk, nosetting the proxy to bypass the Internet filter for a while, but at the end ofthat class he asked me to wait as I was leaving, and then asked if I did thatto the background on purpose or by mistake, I didn’t know if he was trying toget me into more trouble, or if he wanted me to rack up some cool points. I ofcourse said on accident, he wasn’t going to get me in more trouble :-), but then he said,that he thinks it was on purpose and that I should focus on computers. Prettymuch ever since then I have focused on computers, and knew that I wanted to gointo the computer field. I have a lot more stories like this."> <meta name="twitter:site" content="@martinoj2009"> <meta name="twitter:creator" content="@martinoj2009"> <!-- Open Graph --> <meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"> <meta property="og:type" content="article"> <meta property="og:title" content="Hacker Diary - Middle School is where I started"> <meta property="og:description" content="When I was in middle school(~2003) I had my first taste of hacking a server.
