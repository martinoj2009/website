I like the fact that this phone is giving me the specs of a lot of the flagship phones but, without anything else. It doesn't have all the different apps installed like other phones on the market, as a matter of fact they even removed duplicate apps. If Google had an app, they pretty much just used Google's app instead of making their own... for the most part. They still have a few apps, like the launcher but, it's really minimal. As a matter of fact, the launcher is skinned to look like stock Android. </p> <p> This phone doesn't have modular-like features, liquid cooling, or stock Android from Google that will get updates before everyone else. I'm okay with that. I don't think I'll be missing anything for the most part. I have a Nexus 9 and it's giving me a pretty good experience, except when it heats up and lags... something I HATE about Android devices. </p> <h1> My Current Phone </h1> <p> My current phone is an iPhone 6s. I love this thing. It has really good battery life, and smooth. I don't get the heat and lag issues I get with most Android devices I've used. But I miss Android. It gives me the freedom I like. I like Linux, and this gives me a very close experience; however, I wish Google didn't use Java (although they are rumored to be looking at Swift). I switch back and forth between Android and iOS devices, and I like both. </p> <h1> So Why?? </h1> <p> I really like stock Android. I don't like seeing a bunch of crap installed on my Android phone, I'll do that :-D. So I like when I can get a clean phone, or the ability to remove all the bloat. Why? Because all that bloat is eating RAM, CPU and battery. Your phone isn't going to last as long because it's too buys running crap software. Also, a lot of that software is built into the Android image, so the only way it's going to be updated is if they update the phone... and we all know how often our phones get updated. Well, HTC does tend to update their phones, they even have a page when you can see the progress up the updates for your phone. </p> <p> I also REALLY like the build. Yeah, it's nothing revolutionary, but I still love the design of the phone; always liked HTC phone design. The phone just feels artful. I'm not looking for a 10-core CPU and apps for everything I could possibly need. I like a bare phone so I can add what I want. Yeah, I can go with a Nexus device, but I also don't want to spend that money upfront. I'm on T-Mobile, so I get upgrades more often than most with the JUMP! program. I know that's kind of a weak argument, but I'm more interested in the HTC than the 6P. The 6P is nice, and was going to be my next phone; however, I've been an HTC fan for years. My first HTC phone was an HTC Windows 6.5 phone on Sprint. I'm trying to not let my “fanboy” get in the way with this decision, but it's such a nice phone and offers me a very close to stock Android experience, while also not requiring me to pay ~$500. </p> <h1> Never Again Galaxy </h1> <p> Well, I won't say never, just not for a long time. I had two Samsung Galaxy devices (S6, Galaxy Nexus) and they have all been bad experiences. I had the S7 as my first Samsung device and it had heating issues. The phone just sucked and I could barley get through the day with light usage, unlike the iPhone 6 that got me through the day with no problem. The S6 also had heat issues, it would even get hot when I was walking around the house, and I have great signal in my house, even then I would connect to WiFi. I would also get lag to the point of annoyances, especially because how much the phone costs. Updates would also be too slow for me, it seemed like Samsung would move on from their devices quickly. </p> <p> This phone is also a great example of my problem with non-Nexus devices, it was loaded with crap. I didn't need all the crap they installed on the phone, and it was eating up SO much of the RAM. They phone had 3GB of RAM and the phone would use 2GB of the RAM... not with my apps installed. That's crazy, that's more RAM usage than Windows. I don't want to touch another Samsung device for a long time. The LG G5 has battery issues, from looking at my best friend who has one, and my girlfriend has one and is seeing the same issues. So, I think the HTC 10 is the right choice for me. </p>  <div class="entry-meta"> <br> <hr> <span class="entry-tags"><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#smart" title="Pages tagged smart" class="tag"><span class="term">smart</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#phone" title="Pages tagged phone" class="tag"><span class="term">phone</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#htc" title="Pages tagged htc" class="tag"><span class="term">htc</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#10" title="Pages tagged 10" class="tag"><span class="term">10</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#like" title="Pages tagged like" class="tag"><span class="term">like</span></a></span> <span class="social-share"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://martinojones.com/00-00-i-like-the-htc-10/" title="Share on Facebook" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> Like</span> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://martinojones.com/00-00-i-like-the-htc-10/" title="Share on Twitter" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> Tweet</span> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://martinojones.com/00-00-i-like-the-htc-10/" title="Share on Google+" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i> +1</span> </a> </span> <div style="clear:both"></div> </div> </div> </div> </header> <!-- JS --> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery.dlmenu.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery.goup.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery.fitvid.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/scripts.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'martinoj2009'; (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); (function () { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.async = true; s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/count.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('HEAD')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('BODY')[0]).appendChild(s); }()); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a>
