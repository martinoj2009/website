I don't know if I'd pay $60USD for this, however, this is just a beta and I really shouldn't pass judgment on the beta. There's some single player play, but I haven't played much of that; it's a PVE horde mode. I mostly played drop zone, haven't played much Walker Assult.</p> <p> Here's some screen shots, I didn't do too hot for my first match, but in the second match I did a little better... a little better lol. It's going to take me some time to get use to the game and the weapons. This is made like Battlefeild but it doesn't feel like Battlefild... for one there's no countdown to get back into the match, I really like that lol. But here's how I did.</p> <p> <img src="/images/battlefront/1.png"><br> <img src="/images/battlefront/2.png"><br> <img src="/images/battlefront/3.png"><br> <img src="/images/battlefront/4.png"><br> <img src="/images/battlefront/5.png"><br> </p> <p> The drop zone gameplay was fun, it's a smaller map and is good for getting you into the action. It's objective, think of hardpoint from Call of Duty, your capturing small drop ships that drop on the map. The drop zone will showup on your screen through the map and you need to get to that point and hold "E" (I played on PC) and then you will capture the point after a couple of seconds. The map looks good, I mean it's not amazing graphics, but it's not bad at all, it looks good.</p> <p> Now DICE was involved in making this game, at least accroding to Wikipedia... and as I was playing I did notice some rubber banding while playing, so there's some lagging issues... now I can't say it's their game, or something wrong with my connection at the time; however, it's DICE and they're known for that issue in BF Bad Company 2, BF3 and BF4. I played all of them day one and had that issue, but this wasn't that bad. It was still a little annoying as I was running up hills to see myself stop and then shoot forward. I didn't see others on my screen do the same thing, but that depends on your definition of rubber banding. </p> <p> The game feels smooth, although this is the specs of my PC: <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">  CPU: i5
  RAM: 16GB (8 x 2)
  GPU: GTX 970 4GB DDR5
  OS: Windows 10 64bit
  </code></pre></figure> I was getting ~100-150fps with everything on high. I left the graphics settings on auto (which set the graphics to high). I typically don't chage that as my card has been out for a while and I'm sure game devs know what works good with their beta, unless Nvidia Experience says something different, then I'd try their settings out and see what happens. I had no crash or freezing of any kind, just a small amount of lag. It's really good that they gave us a taste of the game now instead of us having some major day one issues, not to say this will fix all issues with day one. Any way, the game runs really good. This is the minimum specs:</p> <p> <b>Minimum PC System Requirements:</b> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">  OS: 64-bit Windows 7 or later
  Processor (Intel): Intel i3 6300T or equivalent

  </code></pre></figure> </p> <p> I would recommend this game, it's free for anyone to play right now on PC, X1 and PS4. I have no clue how the game runs on the consoles, but it ran great on my PC.</p> <div class="entry-meta"> <br> <hr> <span class="entry-tags"><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#i" title="Pages tagged i" class="tag"><span class="term">i</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#like" title="Pages tagged like" class="tag"><span class="term">like</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#star" title="Pages tagged star" class="tag"><span class="term">star</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#wars" title="Pages tagged wars" class="tag"><span class="term">wars</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#battlefront" title="Pages tagged battlefront" class="tag"><span class="term">battlefront</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#video" title="Pages tagged video" class="tag"><span class="term">video</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#games" title="Pages tagged games" class="tag"><span class="term">games</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#pc" title="Pages tagged pc" class="tag"><span class="term">pc</span></a><a href="https://martinojones.com/tags/#game" title="Pages tagged game" class="tag"><span class="term">game</span></a></span> <span class="social-share"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://martinojones.com/i-like-battlefront-so-far/" title="Share on Facebook" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> Like</span> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://martinojones.com/i-like-battlefront-so-far/" title="Share on Twitter" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> Tweet</span> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://martinojones.com/i-like-battlefront-so-far/" title="Share on Google+" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i> +1</span> </a> </span> <div style="clear:both"></div> </div> </div> </div> </header> <!-- JS --> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery.dlmenu.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery.goup.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/jquery.fitvid.min.js"></script> <script src="https://martinojones.com/assets/js/scripts.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'martinoj2009'; (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); (function () { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.async = true; s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/count.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('HEAD')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('BODY')[0]).appendChild(s); }()); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a>
