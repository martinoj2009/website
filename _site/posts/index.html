<p> I was browsing the web like I do from time to time and ran into this OpenSUSE music video. It's kind of ridiculous, but also funny and awesome. I always like when a Linux or open source project try to explain to people the awesomeness of their project, or how important their project is. I'm not a big openSUSE user, I've used it once and that was in a VM because I wanted to see how it performed; it did fine, just not good enough for me to leave Fedora. </p>  <a href="https://martinojones.com/00-00-open-suse-live-kernel-patching-music-video/" class="btn zoombtn">Read More</a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1.5s"> <a class="zoombtn" href="https://martinojones.com/00-00-my-opinions-on-halo-5/">My Opinions About Halo 5</a> <p></p>
<p> I played and beat Halo 5 last week, and I've been talking to other people that also beat it, and it seems we majority agree that this title was shorter. I typically play Halo games on normal the first play through, and then if I like the story (which I typically do) I'll go back through and play the story again. I've played them all, except the RTS Halo Wars, and this one definitely feels like a shorter story, I beat the game in ~4 hours. </p>  <a href="https://martinojones.com/00-00-my-opinions-on-halo-5/" class="btn zoombtn">Read More</a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1.5s"> <a class="zoombtn" href="https://martinojones.com/20-49-my-review-response-of-steam-os-machines/">My Review/Response to Steam Machines and SteamOS</a> <p></p>

<p> I seems like almost every week we hear about some company or government agency getting hacked. It's mostly lots of data being stolen, and the attackers sitting inside of their networks for months, or years. That's not too surprising since the average time for discovering an attack is usually a year… that's really sad. It's also sad that most attacks that happen today don't require an attacker to use any advanced attacks, they don't need to take advantage of any 0dayz or anything like that. For the most part they need to just use social engineering. </p>  <a href="https://martinojones.com/10-28-the-future-of-hacks-may-lead-you-to-debt-or-prison/" class="btn zoombtn">Read More</a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1.5s"> <a class="zoombtn" href="https://martinojones.com/23-02-lets-encrypt-new-milestone/">Let's Encrypt is Now Trusted In All Browsers</a> <p></p>
<p> I'm really excited for this soon to release service called Let's Encrypt. If you have not heard of this service you should check it out. This is a great new service that will allow anyone to have a free SSL/TLS certificate, but not just that, it'll provide scripts to easily install the cert on your server, and this certificate authority will be trusted on your devices. This is a service started by: Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Mozilla Foundation, Akamai, and Cisco Systems. Other partners include the certificate authority IdenTrust, the University of Michigan (U-M), the Stanford Law School, the Linux Foundation[15] as well as Stephen Kent from Raytheon/BBN Technologies and Alex Polvi from CoreOS. A lot of big names involved, so you can trust that this cert will work on your browser... especially with this new update </p>  <a href="https://martinojones.com/23-02-lets-encrypt-new-milestone/" class="btn zoombtn">Read More</a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1.5s"> <a class="zoombtn" href="https://martinojones.com/20-48-tools-of-the-hardware-hacking-trade/">Tools of The Hardware Hacking Trade - Duo Tech Talk</a> <p></p>
<p> I went to two security tech talks yesterday (20151022) and they were good. One was at UofM's SUMIT 2015 conference, the other was Duo Security. The Duo Security tech talk was better. I went to the UofM conference thinking they would show us how to protect ourselfs, but they mostly talked about laws I already knew about and follow. Also talked about methods to protect your networks that I already knew...

I really really really enjoyed watching McFly and Doc Brown go through time trying to fix things, just to have something else go wrong. These films were before my time, I was born in '91, so I didn't really see it until much later... but I still REALLY enjoyed the movies. </p>  <a href="https://martinojones.com/00-00-00-happy-back-to-the-future-day/" class="btn zoombtn">Read More</a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1.5s"> <a class="zoombtn" href="https://martinojones.com/a-world-without-linux/">A World Without Linux</a> <p></p> <p> The Linux Fondation released two videos so far trying to show the common folk what a world without Linux would be like.

<p> I know it sounds weird, but it's actually not that bad. From someone that likes Linux because of how lightweight it is and, not going to lie, hardcore I feel when I'm using it lol. I like how I can open the terminal up and just start programming and scripting without having to install anything else. It's made for developers to get in and just start developing. Granted it's fine as a desktop/laptop OS as well, depnding on what you're doing... gaming was my biggest problem with it, but it's slowly improving. Don't worry, I'm going to get into using PowerShell as your desktop enviroment lol.</p>  <a href="https://martinojones.com/running-windows-with-just-powershell/" class="btn zoombtn">Read More</a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1.5s"> <a class="zoombtn" href="https://martinojones.com/really-like-my-iphone-6s/">I Really like my iPhone 6s so far</a> <p></p>

<p> So, I didn't really move it to Git, I manage my site with Git now. I was using SCP to upload updates to my webserver. But that was getting a little old. SO, I setup Git on my webserver and now I can upload the changes and track them. But it's also much easier to upload changes. One of the biggest is if I remove something, Git will track that and remove it from the Git repo on the server, before I just <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> rm -rf <span class="k">*</span> </code></pre></figure> and then SCP the files back up.

I have to admit when I saw this I got excited, I use to play this and Command and Conquer back in the day on Windows 98. I put too many hours into this game and Command and Conquer. I fire up StarCraft 2 and Command and Conquer Zero Hour every once in a while. I love a good RTS.<br> </p>

</div> <div> <br>
</div> <div> So if you want to give it a try I'll show you how to install it on an Apache server using Ubuntu, but you can use what ever OS you want with Apache. I didn't try this with anything other than Apache because that's something everyone has access to for free.</div> <div> <br>
</div> <div> From Ubuntu you can do a:</div> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> sudo apt-get install apache2 -y</blockquote>  Then type in your password if prompted. Now we need to grab this project. After Apache 2 is done downloading you can move over to your html directory.<br> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> cd /var/www/html</blockquote> You can remove anything under this folder if you don't need anything here. If you have files you want to keep you can just clone the git repository down to its own folder.<br> <br> If you don't want any of the files you can:<br> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> rm -rf /var/www/html/* </blockquote> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> git clone https://github.com/gloomyson/StarCraft.git .</blockquote> If you want your files you can:<br> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> git clone https://github.com/gloomyson/StarCraft.git</blockquote>  That's it, you should then be able to browse to http://(ip address). If you don't know the IP address then you can do an <b>ifconfig</b> or <b>ip addr</b>.<br> <br> Now multiple people can access the site at once to play, however, there's no multiplayer at this time (9/8/2015).  <a href="https://martinojones.com/play-starcraft-in-web-browser-using/" class="btn zoombtn">Read More</a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1.5s"> <a class="zoombtn" href="https://martinojones.com/microsoft-security-bulletin-982015/">Microsoft Security Bulletin 9/8/2015 </a> <p>Microsoft just released their Security Bulletin for 9/8/2015.

This could lead to remote code execution, an attacker can corrupt parts of memory that would allow them to execute code on a victims system. The code would run as that user, but if the attacker also uses a privilege escalation vulnerability they can run as an administrator if the victim isn't already an administrator.

Warning: I wrote this is Visual Studio with a GUI, so I'm making references to objects that you will need to make in the designer, and you will need to name those objects appropriately. You don't need a GUI though, I also added an option where you can pass a /q option to the executable and it will run the program silently without a GUI displayed, I also wrote this to be small and fast, it's only ~700KB when compiled.<br> <br> Well anyway, here's the code that I wrote... it may be a little poorly written in some parts, but I built this over time as I needed to add different

</div> <br> <br> Well the icon is launching "<b>google-chrome-stable</b>" that's not what is launched...<br> <br> So how do you fix this!!! Well, it's actually pretty easy. You need to modify the <b>google-chrome.desktop</b> file in your <b>/usr/share/applications</b> folder. If you don't want to share with other users, or you don't have root access you can also do this to your <b>~/.local/share/applications</b> folder for just your account... although if there's one in your <b>/usr/share/applications</b> folder when you search for "<b><i>Google Chrome</i></b>" you will get two results, you can fix this by changing the name slightly... it won't matter, especially if it's pinned to your favorites.<br> <br> <br> <br> So this is the before:<br> <br> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BAiAAygsiPE/VZIADxgCazI/AAAAAAAAEX0/b0y9A3EUfGc/s1600/before.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BAiAAygsiPE/VZIADxgCazI/AAAAAAAAEX0/b0y9A3EUfGc/s320/before.png" width="283"></a>

</div> <br> Now this is in your file at least 3 times... or at least it was in mine... so if you're using VI just /Exec to find the next string, if you don't know how to use vi... learn:<br> <br> http://www.lagmonster.org/docs/vi.html#search<br> <br> Once you're done, just :wq<br> <br> Now you're not done... now you need to move and move the file back, we want this to happen now. So just:<br> mv google-chrome.desktop google-chrome<br> mv google-chrome google-chrome.desktop<br> <br> Now, if you still have Chrome added to your favorites you need to remove it and then re-add it... after that you should be good... if not you did it wrong ;-D.<br> <br> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wczaj_BH_JM/VZIBbfOXLSI/AAAAAAAAEYE/XhH5-3xNHYE/s1600/done.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wczaj_BH_JM/VZIBbfOXLSI/AAAAAAAAEYE/XhH5-3xNHYE/s320/done.png" width="59"></a>

I'm not sure of an option to do this in PowerShell... so I threw one together.<br> <br> This will be using resources already built into PowerShell for retrieving the key that's pressed down, this isn't a form of key logging; although, those are possible in PowerShell as well-- Windows has about 10 API's for that. This method is detecting the key that's pressed down in your current terminal window, once you click outside that window then it won't detect the key you're pressing.<br> <br> Lets cover the first part of the process, getting the key pressed. To do this you need to understand ASCII to Hex... I will assume you know this, and if not it's pretty easy to do a quick search on this. For this part we will use ASCII character "s" and "S". So, you kind of don't really need to do it by Hex, you can just do it by ASCII... but let's just do it that way ;-). So lets make a variable and set it.<br> <br> $keyPressed = 83<br> <br> Now we need to get the key state. First we will test to make sure it works, I won't go into too much detail, mostly because it doesn't need much explaining, just look through the command and it's pretty self explanatory. Paste this into your PowerShell window:<br> <br> $host.ui.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyUp")<br> <br> The "NoEcho" part, if you haven't already figured it out is to suppress printing the character and then displaying what was pressed. You can also change "IncludeKeyUp" to "IncludeKeyDown" and that will simply display when you press a key down.<br> <br> Now lets throw that into a variable:<br> <br> $key = $host.ui.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyUp")<br> <br> So now we have our keys set, if you paste that in it will wait for you to press a key and once you have it will store the information into our key object.<br> <br> The next thing we can do is test to see if our key we assigned was pressed. We will use an IF statement for this, hopefully you haven't closed down you window, or you have ISE open and you still have those variables ready to go. Here's the IF statement I have constructed:<br> <br> if (($key.VirtualKeyCode -eq $keyPressed))<br> {<br>             Write-Host "You pressed the key `n"<br>             break<br>   }<br> <br> Now you can't throw this all together just yet... or you'll get a bunch of errors. You need one more thing, well two more... The next thing is testing to see if a key has been pressed, if not you'll get a bunch of errors. This next line will test to see if a key has been pressed: This will be thrown into an IF statement later.<br> <br> $host.ui.RawUi.KeyAvailable<br> <br> Cool, now that we have that as well you should have everything you need... well almost, you WILL need to throw this all into a loop, if not it will run once and you won't capture anything :-). SO, I'm going to throw this all together, and you are more than welcome to pick it apart, you have the knowledge of what's going on, I'll just be adding logic in.<br> <br> Warning: I tried this in the ISE and had problems with it detecting my key input. You may have better luck pasting this into PowerShell, instead of running it through the ISE.<br> <br> $keyPressed = 83<br> for ($i = 0; $i -gt -1; $i ++){<br>     write-host "press s"<br>     if ($host.ui.RawUi.KeyAvailable) {<br> <br>         $key = $host.ui.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyUp")<br>         if (($key.VirtualKeyCode -eq $keyPressed)){<br>             Write-Host "You pressed the key `n" -ForegroundColor Green<br>             break<br>         }<br> <br>     }<br> <br> }<br> <br> Now, you do have the option to use a key combination, this can be done by adding the -AND operator in our IF statement. The following will require you to press Control+s to stop the loop.<br> <br> $keyPressed = 83<br> for ($i = 0; $i -gt -1; $i ++){<br>     write-host "press s"<br>     if ($host.ui.RawUi.KeyAvailable) {<br> <br>         $key = $host.ui.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyUp")<br>         if (($key.VirtualKeyCode -eq $keyPressed) -AND ($key.ControlKeyState -match "LeftCtrlPressed")){<br>             Write-Host "You pressed the key `n" -ForegroundColor Green<br>             break<br>         }<br> <br>     }<br> <br> }<br> <br> <br> I was working on this because I'm working on a script to search the event log; although, I'm not really working on it anymore, because I had an initial use for it, but I don't really search through the event log often. I wanted it because there wasn't a quick and simple way to look through my event log looking for errors on my system. Any ways, I'll post that later, I'm sure someone can make use of it, or at least learn from some of the coding. </p> <a href="https://martinojones.com/powershell-detect-when-certain-key-is/" class="btn zoombtn">Read More</a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1.5s"> <a class="zoombtn" href="https://martinojones.com/powershell-get-current-directory-your/">PowerShell - get the current directory your script is in</a> <p>Have you ever needed to make a PowerShell script and needed to get the current location of your running script? Of course you have! It doesn't happen often, but I've written scripts and needed to change certain files I expect to be in the current directory, of course I test to make sure the files are there before doing so... but none of that works unless you know where your script is, and I HATE hard coding locations into a script, I try to always use environment variables, because as a "scripter"/programmer you cannot assume things... duh!<br> <br> Anyway, I will use this old Steammachine script I wrote a while back as an example, let's start with the first line... well first couple:<br> <br> #This is the main script that starts for the Windows SteamBox<br> #Version 0.1.3<br> #Check to make sure Steam is installed<br> #Get location<br> [string]$currentPath=Split-Path ((Get-Variable MyInvocation -Scope 0).Value).MyCommand.Path<br> <br> <br> Yeah I cast the variable, I typically only do that when I change a variable a lot so that I don't do something stupid and assign a number in a variable I expect to be a: string, credential, hex, etc. So as you can see you can take the Split-Path command and use the Get-Variable and retrieve MyInvvocation -Scope 0 and getting the member mycommand and getting the path member on that. Yeah it's a little convoluted, but it works, and it's a one liner :-).<br> <br> Here's the rest of the script, this was something I was using when I first setup my Steammachine on Windows, back when there wasn't enough games on SteamOS to switch over, I don't use it anymore-- as it now runs SteamOS-- and really haven't changed it since I first wrote it... so use at your own risk :-).<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> #This is the main script that starts for the Windows SteamBox<br> #Version 0.1.3<br> #Check to make sure Steam is installed<br> #Get location<br> [string]$currentPath=Split-Path ((Get-Variable MyInvocation -Scope 0).Value).MyCommand.Path<br> <br> #*****************BEING FUNCTIONS*******************#<br> <br> #Run Windows Updates function<br> Function Get-WindowsUpdate {<br> <br>     [Cmdletbinding()]<br>     Param()<br> <br>     Process {<br>         try {<br>             Write-Verbose "Getting Windows Update"<br>             $Session = New-Object -ComObject Microsoft.Update.Session            <br>             $Searcher = $Session.CreateUpdateSearcher()            <br>             $Criteria = "IsInstalled=0 and DeploymentAction='Installation' or IsPresent=1 and DeploymentAction='Uninstallation' or IsInstalled=1 and DeploymentAction='Installation' and RebootRequired=1 or IsInstalled=0 and DeploymentAction='Uninstallation' and RebootRequired=1"           <br>             $SearchResult = $Searcher.Search($Criteria)           <br>             $SearchResult.Updates | Out-File $currentPath\CurrentWindowsUpdates.txt<br>         } catch {<br>             Write-Warning -Message "Failed to query Windows Update because $($_.Exception.Message)" | Out-File $currentPath\ERROR.txt<br>         }<br>     }<br> }<br> <br> <br> #Start script<br> <br> $i = 0<br> do{<br>     [boolean]$SteamFileExists = test-path ${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Steam\Steam.exe<br>     if ($SteamFileExists -eq $True){<br>             $i = 1<br>         }<br>         Else<br>         {<br>             $SteamErrorPopup = new-object -comobject wscript.shell<br>             $SteamErrorAnswer = $SteamErrorPopup.popup(“ERROR!

I was in my computer class and I was really interested in how the computer was able to display our names on the desktop, I already at that time had some experience with browsing the file structure because I had a Windows 3.1 computer in my room, and my parents had a Windows 98 SE machine in the living room. I would click through the computer’s local drive when I was bored of surfing message boards over our dial-up modem, mostly looking at how to bypass Internet filters at school. I would recursively look through the Windows directory, I even picked up some command line experience from those forms.<br> <!--more--><br> </p>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> <br>
</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> I was in computer class one day and became bored, idle hands are never a good ideal for kids, so I started looking through the computer’s local hard drive, so I opened up My Computer on the desktop and found there were additional drives, some I hadn’t seen before. So I started looking through the directories, opening up random files to see what they did or said. At this time class was still on-going, I never really pay attention in computer classes anyways because I was usually way ahead of the class. After a day or two of searching their network drives I ran into a login like script for the machines, it was a script that ran after you logged into Novell. When I opened it I started looking though and noticed a line that referenced a BMP file and saying something about wallpaper, at that time I already knew what BMP’s were from looking through my own computer. So I copied the network location it was referencing and pasted it into my explorer URL bar and deleting the last portion of the location that pointed to the file so that I could look at the directory.</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> <br>
</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> I found the file that the computers used for the background, along with other files they used… but I didn’t really care too much for those, I just wanted the background. So I opened the file with MS Paint… what to do… what to do. At this time I was a BIG PC gamer, I even tried making my own games using GameMaker and The 3D Game Maker, I’ve got a story about some mischievous things I’ve done with GameMaker, that and Batch was how I learned some scripting. Any ways, back to the story. I really enjoyed Halo: CE, I liked playing that online, so of course that’s what I wanted to share, call it free advertising lol. I clicked the text button and wrote “Halo Rules!”—with one or more exclamation marks-- on the background and saved it… yes, it actually saved, the permissions on this network drive weren’t setup properly.</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> <br>
</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> This wasn’t an instantaneous change, the background was only pulled as part of the login, I needed to wait until the next day, as my other classes didn’t use a computer unless we were writing a paper that needed to be type written. The next day we came in I smiled at seeing that written across everyone’s desktop, you would have thought that someone like the principle would have noticed that and had someone remove it. But no, it stayed on there all day, and the next day… so I became a little excited, and me being a kid, wanted to share with my friends.</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> <br>
</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> I had a lot of friends, I wasn’t a typical loner nerd; I had some social skills because I just seem to get along with people, even though they tend to annoy me… a lot. I had been in trouble before, but not as bad as elementary school where I had a pink slip almost every day. At my middle school we had this after school program for playing with SimCity 3000, it was supposed to be a contest for schools to participate in to build the best city, but I just wanted to game… of course I wasn’t going to pass that up, I love PC gaming (simulation, RTS, racing, shooters, etc). I had some friends in this program too, I was having a conversation with one of them and I can’t remember if they asked about the background or if I just wanted to brag, It’s hard to say because peer-pressure never was a problem for me, if people wanted me to do something I didn’t want to do I said no, continuing to ask would typically just make me mad. Anyways, I shared with him the secrets of setting the background.</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> <br>
</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> I didn’t take long, actually the next day, until I saw the background changed, with a lot of different things. If my memory is right, I saw stuff like “You all suck” kind of things. I don’t have much memory of what else they did because it really didn’t last long. The next day, pretty much two days after I told one friend and I’m sure he told others, we were waiting outside to enter the school, everyone waited outside after the bus dropped you off or if you walked to school before they opened the doors, of course they had adults outside too. While we were all waiting, hurdled into a social circles, the principle and someone else from the administration walked out, they were calling my name, and the friend that I told to come inside. My friend and I entered the principal’s office and she asked if I knew anything about the background, I of course said no… she then went on about how my friend said it was me who found it, and that I showed people how to do it… at this point I was giving my “friend” the death stare. She then said she had to pay someone to come in and fix it up, I of course thought “oh shoot, I hope I don’t have to pay” so I said “I could have done that!” She ignored this, I later doubted that they had to pay a dime since the public school contracted that stuff out and who ever responded supported them until the contract was up. Instead she told me not to do it again and sent us both outside… they eventually came back out because me and that “friend” got into a fight that escalated pretty quickly from pushing each other.</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> <br>
</div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"> After then separated us I can’t recall what they did, but I’m sure we got Saturday detention, or in school detention, it’s hard to say because I did get Saturday and in school detention a couple times during middle school; however, I did attend my computer class… that’s when I was informed by my computer instructor that I wasn’t allowed to use any of the computers without supervision… in any of my classes, this wouldn’t be the first time I was told this, I have another story about this happening a couple more times in high school. He pretty much watched me like a hawk, no setting the proxy to bypass the Internet filter for a while, but at the end of that class he asked me to wait as I was leaving, and then asked if I did that to the background on purpose or by mistake, I didn’t know if he was trying to get me into more trouble, or if he wanted me to rack up some cool points. I of course said on accident, he wasn’t going to get me in more trouble<span style="font-family: Wingdings; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings;"> :-)</span></span>, but then he said, that he thinks it was on purpose and that I should focus on computers. Pretty much ever since then I have focused on computers, and knew that I wanted to go into the computer field. I have a lot more stories like this.</div>  <a href="https://martinojones.com/hacker-diary-middle-school-is-where-i/" class="btn zoombtn">Read More</a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li class="wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1.5s"> <a class="zoombtn" href="https://martinojones.com/fix-windows-shell/">Fix the Windows shell</a> <p>Wow, so you completely screwed up your Windows Shell???

They have given us SteamOS users the ability to filter games that run on SteamOS (Linux) and also playable via a controller. This update was rolled out today.<br> <br> I was greeted with a nice update when arriving home today, I always get excited, I must admit, when seeing an update for any of my devices. I read about this update while I was at work, so I had to get home and install it. I was always annoyed when browsing the games on my Steambox running SteamOS because a lot of the games that I could play on the OS (now at over 1.4k) were harder to find because the Windows and Mac games were mixed in, and the Big Picture mode for Steam doesn't show the 8k+ games in its library, I'd have to browse for my games on the desktop client and then buy them.<br> <br> By default-- at least on my installation-- I only see games that run on SteamOS and have controller support in the store, so it's now much easier for me to browse the games that are available for me to play; however, when browsing my games that I have purchased I can still see my non-controller based games, but it will give me an icon when I need a keyboard and mouse in order to play the game.<br> <br> This doesn't mean you cannot change the filter to view all games, you can change the filter by going to your settings, and at the bottom you will see a new option called Store, and there will be a check box that will allow you to view all games, regardless of setup. As a matter of fact they added a section in your games library called <b>Games I Can Play</b>, and this will show you games you can play with your current configuration e.g. games that run on SteamOS and is playable via a controller, for my configuration.<br> <br> This is a small update, but a needed update for the interface as people who are not tech savy, or are use to console based UI-- which is the whole purpose of the distro-- will not want to view a bunch of games they can't even play. I look forward to more updates like this from Steam in the future.<br> <br> </p>

I found something kind of cool. I'm not sure if someone else has found it as well, but <b>Cortana is installed in the Windows 10 Tech Preview, </b>or at least a light version so far. I was browsing around the Windows Store folder that's in your AppData folder and I saw a folder called Microsoft.Cortana(gobaltygouk). That immediately peeked my interest.<br> <br> </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NogMAdjXxSY/VC7Ea_EvIsI/AAAAAAAACOI/a0SMUK_mzD0/s1600/Capture2.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="277" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NogMAdjXxSY/VC7Ea_EvIsI/AAAAAAAACOI/a0SMUK_mzD0/s1600/Capture2.PNG" width="320"></a>
</div> <br> <br> I thought maybe the app was hidden in the system somewhere, but I knew my account... even though I'm an administrator, wouldn't have access to parts of the system, so I wanted complete access. So I locked my station because I already have access to run this thing as the System account (which is like root) so that I can see everything on the machine without limitation, I found a couple :-).<br> <br> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dTzManB4Flw/VC7jDqcHWuI/AAAAAAAACO0/dmdTQPXFyFE/s1600/Capture.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="231" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dTzManB4Flw/VC7jDqcHWuI/AAAAAAAACO0/dmdTQPXFyFE/s1600/Capture.PNG" width="320"></a>

</div> <br> <br> So I then tried to access the WindowsApps directory to see if there's an actual app installed on the machine, I guess in hindsight I could have just changed the owner to my user and just browsed the directory, but eh, I already have access to the System account. I then cd'ed to the directory and sure enough instant access :-) MUHAHAHAHAAA!! I then dir'ed for anything with Cortana in it and got two hits.<br> <br> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-POoKO5Jx1cc/VC7D_tFY75I/AAAAAAAACOA/JK1ozP5kToA/s1600/Capture2.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="153" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-POoKO5Jx1cc/VC7D_tFY75I/AAAAAAAACOA/JK1ozP5kToA/s1600/Capture2.PNG" width="320"></a>
</div> <br> <br> Alright, SO what breaks if I rename the directory?? I go back to the GUI side and give my account ownership of the folder WindowsApps folder. I then rename the folder for Cortana and try clicking on the search option and "Something went wrong." Well I guess we now know this Cortana folder has something to do with the search functionality for Windows 10.<br> <br> <br> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JX-UB4DmXV8/VC7iIgD7ELI/AAAAAAAACOs/4RxEnxDtZt4/s1600/oh.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="314" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JX-UB4DmXV8/VC7iIgD7ELI/AAAAAAAACOs/4RxEnxDtZt4/s1600/oh.PNG" width="320"></a>
</div> <br> <br> <br> So, the search feature that's in Windows 10 is using Cortana, or at least a portion of Cortana, and they just haven't turned the full thing on yet. I'm not able to launch any of the exe's so this is just a metro/modern app being used by Windows.
