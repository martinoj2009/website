<p> I'm really excited for this soon to release service called Let's Encrypt. If you have not heard of this service you should check it out.
  This is a great new service that will allow anyone to have a free SSL/TLS certificate, but not just that, it'll provide scripts to easily install the
  cert on your server, and this certificate authority will be trusted on your devices. This is a service started by:  Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Mozilla Foundation, Akamai, and Cisco Systems. Other partners include the certificate authority IdenTrust, the University of Michigan (U-M), the Stanford Law School, the Linux Foundation[15] as well as Stephen Kent from Raytheon/BBN Technologies and Alex Polvi from CoreOS.
  A lot of big names involved, so you can trust that this cert will work on your browser... especially with this new update
</p>

<p><b> Who is this for? </b></p>

<p>
  Now this isn't for big corporations and businesses. This is for people like me, someone's personal blog. They aren't really going to be puling companies away from the big cert companies, the big cert guys will still have customers getting EV certs. These certs, if I remember correctly, is domain validation only. They're not going to be giving away EV certs.

<p>
  This will be interesting if the government continues with the rumored bill being passed around in the government outlawing encryption.
</p>

<p>
  But they just hit an important mile stone. They are now trusted by all major browsers because they got cross-signatures from IdenTrust.

"We’re pleased to announce that we’ve received cross-signatures from IdenTrust, which means that our certificates are now trusted by all major browsers. This is a significant milestone since it means that visitors to websites using Let’s Encrypt certificates can enjoy a secure browsing experience with no special configuration required.

Both Let’s Encrypt intermediate certificates, Let’s Encrypt Authority X1 and Let’s Encrypt Authority X2, received cross-signatures. Web servers will need to be configured to serve the appropriate cross-signature certificate as part of the trust chain. The Let’s Encrypt client will handle this automatically.

You can see an example of a server using a Let’s Encrypt certificate under a new cross-signed intermediate here.

Vital personal and business information is flowing over the Internet more frequently than ever, and it’s time to encrypt all of it. That’s why we created Let’s Encrypt, and we’re excited to be one big step closer to bringing secure connections to every corner of the Web."
