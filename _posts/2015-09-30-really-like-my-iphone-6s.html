<p><b> This isn't a full review.</b></p>

<p> So, I've had this iPhone 6s for a week now; so far I like it. Before you think I'm an Apple/iPhone fanboy I want to say that I cam from a Galaxy S6. My first phone was a Windows Phone 6.5, some HTC devices, I can't remember the exact model. But I had nothing but Android devices up until I grabbed an iPhone 6. Then I switched to the Galaxy and now I'm on the 6s. </p>

<p>I want to start by saying that the build quality is nice, I don't think there's many people that would debate against the build quality of Apple devices, that being: laptops, desktops, tablets and phones. The body isn't that much different from the iPhone 6, but it's a little thicker and heavier. There's nothing really wrong with that, I tend to like my devices to have some weight. When I went from the Xbox 360 controller to the Xbox One I didn't like the weight drop, I like it to have some weight. The thickness isn't bad either, it's just slightly more, so it feels more durable. I've seen some drop tests and it seems to hold up pretty well, unlike other iPhone is the past lol. </p>

<p>Now, I can't talk about the iPhone 6s without talking about iOS 9, it's buggy. That's not too big of a problem since I came from Android… I don't think anyone that has really used Android can say it's all that stable. It may be buggy, but it's still more stable than the Galaxy S6. Now that's not REALLY the fault of Android, it's more of a fault with Samsung. However, there's still memory problems with Android, and I don't know why the OS needs so much RAM… maybe it's because of Java.</p>

<p>I talk mess about all of the devices I have, not because I don't like them, but because I want them to be better, and you can't make it better by saying nothing. I also hold no allegiance to any of these companies, I use the tool for the job. </p>

<p>The iPhone 6s is good, the 3D touch is good, I can get through an entire day on one battery and sometimes seems to be better than my S6. It's overall pretty solid, I haven't had one app crash, I don't see lag like I did on the S6. It's just an overall solid phone. I will say I do miss the feature set of Android, but I have my Nexus 9 tablet for that.</p>
