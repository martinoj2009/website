Microsoft just released their Security Bulletin for 9/8/2015. There are <b>4 critical</b> vulnerabilities and <b>8 important</b> vulnerabilities. I have a little break down for the critical ones, at the bottom of the page is the source.<br />

<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-094" target="_blank">MS15-094</a> covers IE9 to IE11 on Windows 7 through Windows 10 as long as that version of IE can be installed on that OS. This could lead to remote code execution, an attacker can corrupt parts of memory that would allow them to execute code on a victims system. The code would run as that user, but if the attacker also uses a privilege escalation vulnerability they can run as an administrator if the victim isn't already an administrator. Microsoft has a temporary workaround, restricting access to both:&nbsp;vbscript.dll and jscript.dll<span style="font-family: Consolas, Courier, monospace;"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 17.5499992370605px;">.</span></span></div>

<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-095" target="_blank">MS15-095</a> this covers Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and like MS15-094, could lead to remote code execution. Microsoft has no workaround at this time.&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-097" target="_blank">MS15-097</a> is a vulnerability for Windows (Vista and Server 2008), Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Lync. This is another remote code execution that could effect you if you visit a website that takes advantage of this attack, or view documents that utilizes this vulnerability. There's a temporary workaround, see the vulnerability details.&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-098" target="_blank">MS15-098</a> is a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' Journal while parsing journal files. This could lead to remote code execution. This affects Windows Vista through Windows 10.&nbsp;</div>
