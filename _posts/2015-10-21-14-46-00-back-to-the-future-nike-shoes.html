  Well, there was a rumor going around about Nike selling the shoes they had in the Back To The Future movie... looks like that was true.
</p>

<p>
  If you don't know what I'm talking about here's a video from the movie:

  When I saw that I got excited-- not because of the shoes, shoes don't intrest me that much. Here's what Nike said in their blog post:
  {% highlight text %}
  "Almost 30 years ago, Nike was asked to collaborate on a movie that would feature scenes set in the futuristic world of 2015. The brand was challenged to imagine sneakers that would suit the inhabitants of the advanced era. The innovation team, which regularly looks into a crystal ball of athlete insight and technology to project the future of sport, took that task further."

    Michael J. Fox got his hands on the shoes now, and tweeted:

</p>

<p> This isn't going to be available until spring next year, so if you want your hands on these you should probably start saving, I haven't seen any prices posted online. Here's something else Nike said:
  {% highlight text %}
  "Availability
  The 2015 Nike Mag is a limited edition release. It will only be available via auction, with all proceeds going to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. The specific details on the auctions will be posted to Nike News and via Twitter @Nike in spring 2016. "
