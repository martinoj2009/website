<h1> Superfish </h1>

<p>
I can't really talk about this too much unless you know about what happened with Superfish... I don't want to focus on it too much, so here's what Sophos says:

Your browser thinks it made an end-to-end encrypted connection, and in a sense it did, except that the other end of the connection was not the example.com server – it was the Superfish filter on your own computer.

Lenovo got a lot of crap for this, and now it's an on-going joke in the tech world... You would think how bad they got ripped into no other company would try the same thing... YOU THOUGHT WRONG ;-).

<p>
If you look at the signing date of Dell's cert it's just a couple months after the Superfish controversy with Lenovo... why... whhhyyyyy?????

<h1> What Can An Attacker Do? </h1>

<p>
Well, if an attacker can crack the cert, because it's the same cert on everyones machine, they can perform man-in-the-middle attacks (pretend to be what ever site they want), sign malicious code, sign malicious drivers, and much more because the cert was made to be a general purpose use cert, it has no restictions.
