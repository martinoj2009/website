  <p>
    I finally added commenting to my website. I have been holding off on it for a while, but I finally did it!
  </p>

  <p>
    It was actually a pain, for some reason it just wouldn't work, and I'm not 100% sure how I got it to finally work, but I'm not going to question it lol.

    It will use Disuq since most people don't mind using that service and it's... supposedly easy to setup, but a little hearder for me since I'm using a static site generator... basically it's a flat website, unlike WordPress, Dropal, Blogger and other web applications; this isn't an application at all.

  <p>
    So, if you have something to say and you have an account with: Disuq, Google, Facebook or Twitter then go right ahead :-D.
