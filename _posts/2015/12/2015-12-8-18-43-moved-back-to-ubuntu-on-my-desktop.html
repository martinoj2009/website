  <h1> I still like Fedora </h1>

  <p>
    Let me start by saying I still like Fedora, but there's one thing I don't like... the upgrade process from one version of Fedora to the next.
    I don't even have issues with doing updates, and I like a lot of the packages included with Fedora i.e, the inclusion SELinux.
  </p>

  <h1> Then Why? </h1>

  <p>
    My desktop and laptop were on Fedora 22, then Fedora 23 came out. I upgraded my laptop with no problems, the whole process was smooth, it was pretty much no different than doing a dnf update; with the exception of accepting new GPG keys.
    I waited a couple weeks before moving my desktop as it needs to be stable and just work. If something happened to my laptop it's not as big of a deal, but not my desktop.
  </p>

  <p>
    So a  couple of weeks go by and I finally decide to upgrade to the new version, I like to wait for packages to mature with the new version and for repositories to get updated to support the new version.
    Well, I still had problems... to the point gdm wouldn't load. I have so many packages installed on my main desktop because I do a lot. I like programming, scripting, Docker, virtual machines, editing my website, games and a bunch of other things.
    It took me a while to get it fixed... but I didn't want to go back through that pain again, so I just decided I would just run a slower distro... yeah Fedora isn't rolling, but it's between rolling and stable. It's not unstable, but it's upgrades
    aren't trust worthy like Ubuntu.
