    Well, another year and another set of vulnerabilities. I'm going to try to get this out before all of these websites start posting about something they know very little about. Almost every year I see these sites post about the vulnerable systems of the year and it's almost always misguided, either intentionally or unintentionally. I want to fill you in on the vulnerabilities before they spew complete garbage out of their mouths… well fingers lol.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything I'm saying in this post can be seen on https://cvedetails.com and I'm only focusing on vulnerabilities and the types of vulnerabilities, not the rate of attack and exploitation. Also, you need to keep in mind this is reported vulnerabilities… if the software is closed source you can't say with 100% certainty that someone didn't hide a vulnerability, if it's open source you can't say with 100% certainty that someone could hid a vulnerability. Think with facts, not emotion when you read this. I know that's going to irk some people, but I don't really care.

    I will start by going over the vulnerabilities in each OS, in alphabetical order-- that's starting with “C” for Chrome OS. Followed by: “L” for Linux, “O” for OS X, and “W” for Windows. I will be covering Windows 10, 8.1 (that includes 8.1U1) and 7 as those are the supported versions (excluding Server versions). When I cover Windows I will combine them all first. Why? Because when you look at vulnerabilities in Linux it covers MANY supported versions of Linux this year, so it's only fair to include the supported versions of Windows.

  <h1> Chrome OS </h1>

  <p>
    Hmm, well… I don't see any for 2015. SO! I will assume you're using the Chrome browser. So, I will count 0 for the OS, but I will at least let you know how vulnerable the Chrome browser was. In 2015 the Chrome browser had <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/15031/Google-Chrome.html?vendor_id=1224"> <b>185</b> </a> vulnerabilities. Among those vulnerabilities the majority of them were Denial Of Service(<a href=”https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-1224/product_id-15031/year-2015/opdos-1/Google-Chrome.html”><b>122</b></a>). The second was Overflow(<a href=”https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-1224/product_id-15031/year-2015/opov-1/Google-Chrome.html”><b>36</b></a>). The least was Gain Privileges(<a href=”https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-1224/product_id-15031/year-2015/opgpriv-1/Google-Chrome.html”><b>2</b></a>).

    Here's a graphical break down of the vulnerabilities:

  <h1> Linux </h1>

  <p>
    When I'm talking about Linux I'm talking about the Kernel, there's WAY too many Linux distros for me to cover. You also need to keep in mind when someone say Linux they're talking about a kernel. To say a vulnerability exists in Ubuntu means it's a vulnerability in Linux is technically incorrect, it's like taking the kernel for Windows 10 and making your own OS with it, then the login software you programmed had a vulnerability and people said Windows had a vulnerability… that makes no sense. So NO, if Ubuntu and other distros have a vulnerability in something other than the Kernel that doesn't mean Linux has a vulnerability. Glad I can clear that up. Lets begin.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2015 Linux had <a href=”http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-33/product_id-47/year-2015/Linux-Linux-Kernel.html”><b>68</b></a> vulnerabilities. The majority of them being Denial of Service(<a href=”http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-33/product_id-47/year-2015/opdos-1/Linux-Linux-Kernel.html”><b>43</b></a>). The second most was Gain Privileges(<a href=”http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-33/product_id-47/year-2015/opgpriv-1/Linux-Linux-Kernel.html”><b>15</b></a>). The least was Memory Corruption(<a href=”http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-33/product_id-47/year-2015/opmemc-1/Linux-Linux-Kernel.html”><b>2</b></a>).
