  Halo 5 is almost here, and I'm VERY excited. A little upset there's no split screen coop exits in this new version... that's really dissapointing because I wanted to
  play this version with my girlfriend, but I guess we can take turns or something, not going to buy two X1's just to play a game together.

  I've really enjoyed the series. It's been one of my favorite gaming series; up there with: Uncharted, The Last of Us (not a series, just a good game), Zelda, Mass Effect, Half-Life, and Bioshock (not in any order, and what I can remember off the top of my head). I liked those series and Halo's because of the stories really caught my attention, and they seem to stand out from other games to me. The only other game that comes close to something like Uncharted is Tomb Raider and Mad Max, but those games had their own feel to them. I've yet to play a game like Halo, the story and enviroment really sets it apart form other games I've played.

  But Halo 5 is coming out, I'm going to get this of course, I've played every Halo… well, not the RTS (Halo Wars), but they're supposed to make a new version of that (http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/4/9095027/halo-wars-2-pc-xbox-one), I might play that.

  I can't think of any other game in the category of Halo, some might have come close, but most just attempt to either mimic COD/BF or try to make their own genre. The world is Very immersive and the story is enticing. There's also so much more to the world if you want to dig deeper into it with the comics and the up and coming TV series.

  I remember when I first started playing Halo, it was Halo Combat Evolved and I got my first sight of it at a friends house. He was playing it on his PC, he was being dropped off from a ship and a jeep (M12) dropped in front of him. He then showed me this awesome game, it looked great… I had low expectations as did others back in those days. Then he showed me the online multiplayer… I was giddy, I wanted to get my hands on it.
  From that day on I had to play every Halo that came out, it was awesome because my younger sister also liked the games, her and I played every subsequent game that came out, except Halo Wars. I liked RTS games, but I liked Command and Conquer much better, as well as Star Craft.

  It's been a long time, and it's VERY easy to loose track of the story with all these other games coming out, so Xbox was so kind enough to help us catch up on the Halo story to get us ready for the next entry into the series. Check the videos out below!
