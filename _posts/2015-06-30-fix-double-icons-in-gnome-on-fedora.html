So I installed Chrome on my computer, I have just been using Friefox as it works fine for the most part, except I like to run Android apps every once in a while (Linux doesn't have a good podcast program that I like, so I use an Android podcast app), and Chrome also provides some other useful things.<br />
<br />
So I installed it, and of course added it to my favorites. Once I launch it I get two Chrome icons... yeah, removing it and re-adding doesn't fix it, and it only makes that second icon when you launch the application... so what's going on?<br />

<br />
Well the icon is launching "<b>google-chrome-stable</b>" that's not what is launched...<br />
<br />
So how do you fix this!!! Well, it's actually pretty easy. You need to modify the <b>google-chrome.desktop</b> file in your <b>/usr/share/applications</b> folder. If you don't want to share with other users, or you don't have root access you can also do this to your <b>~/.local/share/applications</b> folder for just your account... although if there's one in your <b>/usr/share/applications</b> folder when you search for "<b><i>Google Chrome</i></b>" you will get two results, you can fix this by changing the name slightly... it won't matter, especially if it's pinned to your favorites.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So this is the before:<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After:<br />
<br />

<br />
Now this is in your file at least 3 times... or at least it was in mine... so if you're using VI just /Exec to find the next string, if you don't know how to use vi... learn:<br />

<br />
Once you're done, just :wq<br />
<br />
Now you're not done... now you need to move and move the file back, we want this to happen now. So just:<br />
mv google-chrome.desktop google-chrome<br />
mv google-chrome google-chrome.desktop<br />
<br />
Now, if you still have Chrome added to your favorites you need to remove it and then re-add it... after that you should be good... if not you did it wrong ;-D.<br />
