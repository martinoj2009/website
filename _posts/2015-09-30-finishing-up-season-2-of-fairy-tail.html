  <p> So I've been making my way through season 2 of Fairy Tail. The show so far
    is really good. I mean the main character is never in any real danger, as with
    most anime, or shows for that matter. But over all the show keeps me entertained.
    I like the action and comedy in the show. I mean it's no Attack on Titan, but
    it's a good show nonetheless.</p>

    <p> This would be a show that I would recommend to others. Even if you don't
      like anime shows, it's still a pretty good show, I don't know about it being
      appropriate for kids, as it has a light about of fan service... a bit titalating.
      But if you're a mature person and can handle over emphasizing of the boobs then
      this show will be fine for you.</p>

      <p> I haven't written about this show before, I started watching this show
        before I started this blog, and after I stopped using my old blog. So I might
        write about it a little more on this site.</p>

        <p> But anywho, it's a pretty good show. I'm almost done with season 2 where
          Natsu just defeated the Daphne and her fake dragon. I don't want to spoil the
          show, so I won't go into too much detail... although I guess telling you he beat
          her is kind of spoiling it... even though he's the main character and did
          you really thing he'd loose??? </p>

          <p> Anywho, I highly suggest giving the show a try. It starts off a
            little slow, but it picks up. The seasons are also pretty long, so if
            you purchase a season then it's going to include a lot of content. Season
            2 is 43 episodes long... so yeah, a lot of story. </p>
