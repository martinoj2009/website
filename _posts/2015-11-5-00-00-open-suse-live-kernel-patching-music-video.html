I was browsing the web like I do from time to time and ran into this OpenSUSE music video. It's kind of ridiculous, but also funny and awesome. I always like when a Linux or open source project try to explain to people the awesomeness of their project, or how important their project is. I'm not a big openSUSE user, I've used it once and that was in a VM because I wanted to see how it performed; it did fine, just not good enough for me to leave Fedora.

I REALLY like live kernel patching, ever since Linux kernel 4.0 you've had the ability to patch your kernel live without needing to use openSUSE's software, or other third-party software. Can you imagine, you never have to reboot your desktop, server, phone, etc after a kernel updateâ€¦ that's awesome! No more reboots lol, just leave it all turned on.

This video does a pretty good job, in my opinon, to get the message across the awesomeness of live kernel patching, and will hopefully get business owners to get their IT to upgrade to the latest kernel if they haven't already to take advantage of it. Check out the video below:
