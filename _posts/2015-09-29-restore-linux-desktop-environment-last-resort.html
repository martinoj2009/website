  <p>So I ran into an issue not too long ago where I misconfigured something.
  I couldn't figure out exactly what I did because I changed a lot of things at once.
  So, more than one configuration files had been changed... I spent a couple hours
  trying to figure out what I did. I did this on Ubuntu and it broke the desktop enviroment,
  even though I do the same thing on Fedora and it bounced back with no problem...
  That's typically why I use Fedora, it doesn't break as easily, and if it does
  it's pretty easy for ME to get it back up and running. Because Ubuntu is so
  customized it's easy for me to break it, and a little harder for me to fix it.</p>

  <p>Now that's not to say it couldn't be fixed. I could have eventually fixed the issue;
  however, I didn't want to spend any more time doing this. SO I just blew away my config
  and started over. So, if you end up doing the same thing as me, here's a way to get
  back in.</p>
