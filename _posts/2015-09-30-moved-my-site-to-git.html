<p> So, I didn't really move it to Git, I manage my site with Git now.
  I was using SCP to upload updates to my webserver. But that was getting a little
  old. SO, I setup Git on my webserver and now I can upload the changes and track
  them. But it's also much easier to upload changes. One of the biggest is if
  I remove something, Git will track that and remove it from the Git repo on the
  server, before I just {% highlight bash%} rm -rf * {% endhighlight %} and then
  SCP the files back up. Yeah, but now everything is easier now :-).</p>
