  <p>Looks like Derbycon 5 is on YouTube now. I started downloading the playlist
    of videos so that I can listen/watch them on my way to work/school. Hopefully
    I can get through the list of +100 presentations lol. I will of course skip
    some less intrestig ones, and there's going to be some with poor audio, so
    I'll be skipping those as well. But I'll throw them on my Plex media server
    so that I can listen from anywhere and keep track of what I have listned to.</p>

    <p>You can head over to https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNhlcxQZJSm8cr3iBN27VZ4Rm11Erbae-
      to start the playlist of presentations. Again, you'll run into some with very
      bad audio.</p>
