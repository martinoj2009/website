(~2003) I had my first taste of hacking a server. I was in my computer class
and I was really interested in how the computer was able to display our names
on the desktop, I already at that time had some experience with browsing the
file structure because I had a Windows 3.1 computer in my room, and my parents
had a Windows 98 SE machine in the living room. I would click through the
computer’s local drive when I was bored of surfing message boards over our
dial-up modem, mostly looking at how to bypass Internet filters at school. I
would recursively look through the Windows directory, I even picked up some command
line experience from those forms.<br />

I was in computer class one day and
became bored, idle hands are never a good ideal for kids, so I started looking
through the computer’s local hard drive, so I opened up My Computer on the
desktop and found there were additional drives, some I hadn’t seen before. So I
started looking through the directories, opening up random files to see what
they did or said. At this time class was still on-going, I never really pay
attention in computer classes anyways because I was usually way ahead of the
class. After a day or two of searching their network drives I ran into a login
like script for the machines, it was a script that ran after you logged into
Novell. When I opened it I started looking though and noticed a line that referenced
a BMP file and saying something about wallpaper, at that time I already knew
what BMP’s were from looking through my own computer. So I copied the network
location it was referencing and pasted it into my explorer URL bar and deleting
the last portion of the location that pointed to the file so that I could look
at the directory.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
I found the file that the computers
used for the background, along with other files they used… but I didn’t really
care too much for those, I just wanted the background. So I opened the file
with MS Paint… what to do… what to do. At this time I was a BIG PC gamer, I
even tried making my own games using GameMaker and The 3D Game Maker, I’ve got
a story about some mischievous things I’ve done with GameMaker, that and Batch
was how I learned some scripting. Any ways, back to the story. I really enjoyed
Halo: CE, I liked playing that online, so of course that’s what I wanted to
share, call it free advertising lol. I clicked the text button and wrote “Halo
Rules!”—with one or more exclamation marks-- on the background and saved it…
yes, it actually saved, the permissions on this network drive weren’t setup
properly.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
This wasn’t an instantaneous
change, the background was only pulled as part of the login, I needed to wait
until the next day, as my other classes didn’t use a computer unless we were writing
a paper that needed to be type written. The next day we came in I smiled at
seeing that written across everyone’s desktop, you would have thought that someone
like the principle would have noticed that and had someone remove it. But no,
it stayed on there all day, and the next day… so I became a little excited, and
me being a kid, wanted to share with my friends.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
I had a lot of friends, I wasn’t a
typical loner nerd; I had some social skills because I just seem to get along
with people, even though they tend to annoy me… a lot. I had been in trouble
before, but not as bad as elementary school where I had a pink slip almost
every day. At my middle school we had this after school program for playing
with SimCity 3000, it was supposed to be a contest for schools to participate
in to build the best city, but I just wanted to game… of course I wasn’t going
to pass that up, I love PC gaming (simulation, RTS, racing, shooters, etc). I
had some friends in this program too, I was having a conversation with one of
them and I can’t remember if they asked about the background or if I just wanted
to brag, It’s hard to say because peer-pressure never was a problem for me, if
people wanted me to do something I didn’t want to do I said no, continuing to
ask would typically just make me mad. Anyways, I shared with him the secrets of
setting the background.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">
I didn’t take long, actually the
next day, until I saw the background changed, with a lot of different things.
If my memory is right, I saw stuff like “You all suck” kind of things. I don’t
have much memory of what else they did because it really didn’t last long. The
next day, pretty much two days after I told one friend and I’m sure he told
others, we were waiting outside to enter the school, everyone waited outside
after the bus dropped you off or if you walked to school before they opened the
doors, of course they had adults outside too. While we were all waiting, hurdled
into a social circles, the principle and someone else from the administration
walked out, they were calling my name, and the friend that I told to come inside.
My friend and I entered the principal’s office and she asked if I knew anything
about the background, I of course said no… she then went on about how my friend
said it was me who found it, and that I showed people how to do it… at this
point I was giving my “friend” the death stare. She then said she had to pay
someone to come in and fix it up, I of course thought “oh shoot, I hope I don’t
have to pay” so I said “I could have done that!” She ignored this, I later doubted
that they had to pay a dime since the public school contracted that stuff out
and who ever responded supported them until the contract was up. Instead she
told me not to do it again and sent us both outside… they eventually came back
out because me and that “friend” got into a fight that escalated pretty quickly
from pushing each other.</div>

After then separated us I can’t
recall what they did, but I’m sure we got Saturday detention, or in school
detention, it’s hard to say because I did get Saturday and in school detention
a couple times during middle school; however, I did attend my computer class…
that’s when I was informed by my computer instructor that I wasn’t allowed to
use any of the computers without supervision… in any of my classes, this wouldn’t
be the first time I was told this, I have another story about this happening a
couple more times in high school. He pretty much watched me like a hawk, no
setting the proxy to bypass the Internet filter for a while, but at the end of
that class he asked me to wait as I was leaving, and then asked if I did that
to the background on purpose or by mistake, I didn’t know if he was trying to
get me into more trouble, or if he wanted me to rack up some cool points. I of
course said on accident, he wasn’t going to get me in more trouble<span style="font-family: Wingdings; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings;"> :-)</span></span>, but then he said,
that he thinks it was on purpose and that I should focus on computers. Pretty
much ever since then I have focused on computers, and knew that I wanted to go
into the computer field. I have a lot more stories like this.</div>
