So I was browsing around the file system, like I do any new OS I play around with to see what new exe's I find, and what easter eggs I can find... I found something kind of cool. I'm not sure if someone else has found it as well, but <b>Cortana is installed in the Windows 10 Tech Preview, </b>or at least a light version so far. I was browsing around the Windows Store folder that's in your AppData folder and I saw a folder called Microsoft.Cortana(gobaltygouk). That immediately peeked my interest.<br />

I thought maybe the app was hidden in the system somewhere, but I knew my account... even though I'm an administrator, wouldn't have access to parts of the system, so I wanted complete access. So I locked my station because I already have access to run this thing as the System account (which is like root) so that I can see everything on the machine without limitation, I found a couple :-).<br />

So I then tried to access the WindowsApps directory to see if there's an actual app installed on the machine, I guess in hindsight I could have just changed the owner to my user and just browsed the directory, but eh, I already have access to the System account. I then cd'ed to the directory and sure enough instant access :-) MUHAHAHAHAAA!! I then dir'ed for anything with Cortana in it and got two hits.<br />

Alright, SO what breaks if I rename the directory?? I go back to the GUI side and give my account ownership of the folder WindowsApps folder. I then rename the folder for Cortana and try clicking on the search option and "Something went wrong." Well I guess we now know this Cortana folder has something to do with the search functionality for Windows 10.<br />

<br />
<br />
So, the search feature that's in Windows 10 is using Cortana, or at least a portion of Cortana, and they just haven't turned the full thing on yet. I'm not able to launch any of the exe's so this is just a metro/modern app being used by Windows. I'm not able to run the exe "searchui.exe."<br />

This was just ~an hour of research, I'm sure over time me and others will be able to find more things that might be hidden away in this preview, or future updates. I don't think personally this is a HUGE fine, but I thought it was interesting and wanted to share. If I find more things I will defiantly share them with you all :-).<br />
