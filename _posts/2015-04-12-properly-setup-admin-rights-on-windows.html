In this video I show you how to properly setup administrative rights on a Windows machine. You really shouldn't be running as an administrator when browsing the Internet, or performing daily tasks, you should have a secondary account setup for doing admin tasks. I also show how to enumerate local admin accounts so you don't have to type in the username of the admin account each time.<br />
