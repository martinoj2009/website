  I went to two security tech talks yesterday (20151022) and they were good. One was
  at UofM's SUMIT 2015 conference, the other was Duo Security. The Duo Security tech talk was better.
  I went to the UofM conference thinking they would show us how to protect ourselfs, but they
  mostly talked about laws I already knew about and follow. Also talked about methods to protect
  your networks that I already knew... I follow a LOT of security podcasts, so news isn't anything
  I lack on.

  Well I figured I would share this video about the tech talk at Duo Security, I went to my first meetup and
  it was awesome, I'm going to look at going to more. It's seems like a great way to network with other security
  folk.
