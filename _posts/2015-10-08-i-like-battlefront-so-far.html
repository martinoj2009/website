<p> I've been playing the Star Wars Battlefront Beta for a couple hours... it's
  pretty good. I don't know if I'd pay $60USD for this, however, this is just a
  beta and I really shouldn't pass judgment on the beta. There's some single player
  play, but I haven't played much of that; it's a PVE horde mode. I mostly played
  drop zone, haven't played much Walker Assult.</p>

  <p> Here's some screen shots, I didn't do too hot for my first match, but in the
    second match I did a little better... a little better lol. It's going to take me
    some time to get use to the game and the weapons. This is made like Battlefeild
    but it doesn't feel like Battlefild... for one there's no countdown to get back
    into the match, I really like that lol. But here's how I did.</p>

<p> The drop zone gameplay was fun, it's a smaller map and is good for getting you
  into the action. It's objective, think of hardpoint from Call of Duty, your capturing
  small drop ships that drop on the map. The drop zone will showup on your screen
  through the map and you need to get to that point and hold "E" (I played on PC)
  and then you will capture the point after a couple of seconds. The map looks good,
  I mean it's not amazing graphics, but it's not bad at all, it looks good.</p>

<p> Now DICE was involved in making this game, at least accroding to Wikipedia...
  and as I was playing I did notice some rubber banding while playing, so there's
  some lagging issues... now I can't say it's their game, or something wrong with
  my connection at the time; however, it's DICE and they're known for that issue in
  BF Bad Company 2, BF3 and BF4. I played all of them day one and had that issue, but
  this wasn't that bad. It was still a little annoying as I was running up hills
  to see myself stop and then shoot forward. I didn't see others on my screen do
  the same thing, but that depends on your definition of rubber banding. </p>

<p> The game feels smooth, although this is the specs of my PC:
  {% highlight text %}
  CPU: i5
  RAM: 16GB (8 x 2)
  GPU: GTX 970 4GB DDR5
  OS: Windows 10 64bit
  {% endhighlight %}

  I was getting ~100-150fps with everything on high. I left the graphics settings
  on auto (which set the graphics to high). I typically don't chage that as my card
  has been out for a while and I'm sure game devs know what works good with their
  beta, unless Nvidia Experience says something different, then I'd try their settings
  out and see what happens. I had no crash or freezing of any kind, just a small
  amount of lag. It's really good that they gave us a taste of the game now instead
  of us having some major day one issues, not to say this will fix all issues with
  day one. Any way, the game runs really good. This is the minimum
  specs:</p>

<p> I would recommend this game, it's free for anyone to play right now on PC, X1 and
  PS4. I have no clue how the game runs on the consoles, but it ran great on my PC.</p>
