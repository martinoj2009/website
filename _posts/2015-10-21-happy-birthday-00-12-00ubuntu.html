<p> Today-- well yeasterday-- is Ubuntu's birthday... give me a break, I've been busy lol.
  Ubuntu has turned 11... yesterday. They launched back in 2004, and looking at the screen shots
  I see a lot of brown, don't really see that anymore; I like the new color MUCH better, looks
  brighter, not depressing lol.
</p>

<p> I remember when I first got into Ubuntu, it was version 9.04 and I was in high school. I was in my RCTC program,
  it was a CST (computer systems technology) class; I really liked that class. But when
  we were learning how computers worked I got my first taste of Linux, and I liked it.
  I didn't make it my main system, I stayed on Windows; however, I really liked the OS.
  I didn't really understand how the OS worked to make he move, plus I needed my Sims, Sim City and
  Command and Conquer games. I didn't know about Wine, nor do I know if that would have worked.
</p>

<p> I like an image <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/">OMGUbuntu</a> has. If you don't know about this site and you want to know more
  about Ubuntu, or just Linux, I would highly suggest checking the site out... yeah, I'm using their
  image. I hope they don't mind lol...
