<p> I know it sounds weird, but it's actually not that bad. From someone that likes
  Linux because of how lightweight it is and, not going to lie, hardcore I feel
  when I'm using it lol. I like how I can open the terminal up and just start programming
  and scripting without having to install anything else. It's made for developers
  to get in and just start developing. Granted it's fine as a desktop/laptop OS as well,
  depnding on what you're doing... gaming was my biggest problem with it, but it's
  slowly improving. Don't worry, I'm going to get into using PowerShell as your
  desktop enviroment lol.</p>

  <p> I mostly did this just to see if I could do it... I can, and it works fine.
    Granted I have a lot of experience with PowerShell, but others that are new
    to PowerShell can learn PowerShell MUCH better by forcing themselfs to use it
    as a desktop enviroment. That's how I learned Linux, I would install a distro like
    Ubuntu and remove X11 and just use command line. Windows out-of-the-box won't
    be as useful without the GUI; however, it's still useable; you'll have to call
    some GUI control panel applet from time to time to do something that Linux could
    easily do in the command line built-in.</p>

    <p> The setup actually isn't all that difficult. All you have to do is edit the
      registry. Edit the
      {% highlight ruby %} HKLocalMachine/Software/Microsoft/WindowsNT/CurrentVersion/Winlogon/Shell{% endhighlight %}
      and change explorer.exe to powershell... that's it. :-D</p>

      <p> Now, for launching applications lol, I just made a PowerShell profile and
        started throwing aliases in there. Made an alias for: firefox, outlook and
        a bunch of other things. That way I don't have to type in the full path, I can
        just say firefox and it will launch the application.</p>

        <p> If this doesn't teach you some PowerShell I don't know what will. You
          just need to stay in this enviroment for a while, do searches on how to do
          things... and for switching between applications you just have to alt-tab a lot lol,
          or snap applications. I also put the time in the prompt, although, I'm just going
          to either program a clock application that stays on top, or download one.</p>
