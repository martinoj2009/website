<p> I use Jekyll for my blog now, but the problem with that is I have to manually
  go into the posts directory and write my posts. It's not like WordPress or Drupal
  where I can just go to a webpage and get a WYSISYG editor and it posts to the blog.
  I have to put the file in the posts folder with the: layout type, name, title, time and tags.
  Then I need to build the blog site, then I can take the contents from the site folder
  and upload it to my webserver, well I use Git for that; however, I'm debating on
  using rsync because Git takes a little more space. I also don't really need the tracking
  because I keep a local copy on my laptop... although if I move to another machine
  it would be easy to: {% highlight bash %} git pull {% endhighlight %}</p>

<p> Anyway, I made a script that accepts two arguments, the first argument is required.
  You pass in the location of the file you want to post, if it's in the current directory
  you just need to pass in the name. The second argument is optional, it's the location
  of your blog, it will test for a folder called _posts so you need to make sure that's in blog
  folder location.</p>

  <p> This is a work in progress, there's some other things I want to add to it. And this is
  is version 1.0.</p>
